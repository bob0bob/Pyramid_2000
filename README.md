In August 2007 my article on Text Adventure Gaming was published in Circuit Cellar magazine. I ported the game to play on a Propeller microcontroller.

****Colossal Cave Adventure

The Wikipedia says that Colossal Cave Adventure was the first computer text adventure game. The original source, recovered from Don Wood's student account at Stanford, is about 700 lines of FORTRAN with another 700 lines of data. It ran on giant mainframe computers in the mid 1970s. Many versions of the game began to appear shortly after. David Platt's Adventure550 was among the most popular. It featured an adventure language he called A-code and an interpreter for the language written in FORTRAN. Platt translated the game logic into his A-code language and enhanced it to score a max of 550 points.

****Pyramid 2000 Implementation

The game includes colorful responses to certain command requests -- like rubbing the lamp:
RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT
PARTICULARLY REWARDING. ANYWAY,
NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.

Colossal Cave is based on an actual section of Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. Pyramid 2000 changes the setting from a cave to a pyramid, but the original flow and most of the descriptions are still based on Mammoth Cave.

In Adventure, the description for the place labeled "WENDMISTS" is:

"You are at the west end of Hall of Mists. A low wide crawl continues west and another goes north. To the south is a little passage 6 feet off the floor."

In Pyramid 2000, the description for Room 19 is almost identical:
YOU ARE AT THE WEST END OF THE
HALL OF GODS. A LOW WIDE PASS
CONTINUES WEST AND ANOTHER GOES
NORTH. TO THE SOUTH IS A LITTLE
PASSAGE SIX FEET OFF THE FLOOR.
